              <h3 class="over__title">Our <strong>history</strong> </h3>
              <p class="over__text">The chairman (Early Bouwman) has been visiting Acapulco / Mexico regularly since 2001 and knows many people there. Unfortunately, he was the victim of an accident there in 2006 and lost his entire left leg and almost the right one as well.
                After a few years of rehabilitation, he took the plunge and travelled to Acapulco again. Knowing that people there have no health insurance and earn about 10 euros a day, he took the prosthesis, which had supported him for years but did not fit anymore, with him. It would otherwise end up in the rubbish bin.</p>
              <p class="over__text">Strolling through Acapulco, he meets a man with one leg on the corner of a street. Early Bouman spoke to him and asked if he might like to try on the prosthesis he had brought along. The man immediately said "Yes!" and Early Bouman arranged an appointment with the hospital. He convinces the hospital that they will tailor his prosthesis for free and help the man rehabilitate. This went well and after 34 years of not being able to walk, this man is now on his feet again.</p>
              <p class="over__text">The following year, Early Bouman did this again for another person. Meanwhile, Early Bouman had inquired at a prosthetic manufacturer what they did with discarded prostheses and/or aids. He was told that most of them were thrown away. So, he came up with a proposal to personally take them to the hospital in Acapulco and distribute them to those in need of prostheses and/or aids. He was given three large suitcases full which he transported at his own expense.</p>

              <h3 class="over__title">Our <strong>vision</strong> </h3>
              <p class="over__text">What Early Bouman did as an individual deserves to be emulated! In our opinion, with more prostheses and other aids, it is possible to help people with disabilities in different parts of the world and make them count in society again. Unfortunately, thousands of people in Latin America and Africa, suffer from some form of disability, whether congenital, due to illness or accidental. To for example be able to walk, these people need access to prostheses and other aids. Due to the high cost, very few people have access to these. Therefore, we are a non-profit foundation with the aim of helping as many people in need as possible to improve their quality of life. We would like to see more people come out of isolation because they are mobile or manualised (again).</p>
              <p class="over__text">We would like to donate the prostheses and other aids that would otherwise end up in the dumps, for the time being, to people in need of those in the already known places in Mexico and Africa. We recognise that prostheses and other aids are also in demand closer to home, but we only want to take these prostheses and other aids to places that are known to us as safe and reliable.</p>

              <h3 class="over__title">Our <strong>goal</strong> </h3>
              <p class="over__text">By 2022, there were 6 suitcases full, filled with prostheses and other aids such as crutches, braces, wheelchairs and slings, which were lovingly received in Mexico by the C.E.O of all local hospitals (B.I.F) in Acapulco, but the costs were still at own expense.
                2
                Early Bouman's uncle, with a project in Gambia (Africa), also sent 2 suitcases there and personally went to see if they were well received.</p>
              <p class="over__text">In February 2023, 12 suitcases were given to the governor of Guerrero state (Evelyn Salgado). Despite support and contributions from friends and acquaintances, this too was a costly action.
                The plan is to take many suitcases to Mexico and Africa in the coming years. Also, Cuba and other less fortunate countries are on our list to receive donations. Our goal is to bring as much protheses and other aids as possible to more diverse countries.</p>
